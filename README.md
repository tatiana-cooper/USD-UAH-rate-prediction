In this project I mastered:

**Python** <br>
**Sklearn (LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor, KNeighborsRegressor, MLPRegressor)**<br>
 **Pandas**<br>
 **Matplotlib**<br>


## Files
> usd_rate_prediction.ipynb — this file preprocesses all data for USD rate predictions and does predictions.

> usd_rate.xlsx — document was taken from official web-site of Ukrainian National Bank ([https://bank.gov.ua/ua/markets/exchangerate-chart](https://bank.gov.ua/ua/markets/exchangerate-chart)). The file shows the USD exchange rate against the UAH from 01/10/2017 to 07/10/20. Document was preprocessed and modified according to current research needs.


## Installation
This project requires Python 3+, Jupyter Notebook.
### Clone

Clone this repo to your local machine using  `https://github.com/tatiana-cooper/USD-UAH-rate-prediction.git`

### Setup
Launch 'usd_rate_prediction.ipynb' using Jupyter Notebook.


## Features
Comparison of three Machine Learning algorithms trained to predict future rate of USD to UAH.
